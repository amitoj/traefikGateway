    # traefik.yourdomain is running on 192.168.1.nn:443
    # It only allows https inbound connections.

    # A second instance of traefik is requred to access resources
    # on a different subnet only accessible via port forwarding. 
    # In my router (192.168.1.mm) I port forward to 81 to 192.168.86.nn:80
    # (The router is using port 80 already) 
    # All services I want to publish on the 192.168.86/24 network are configured
    # traefikinner.
    # 
    # Create this filebased router and service to reach the related router and service
    # running on the traefikinner instance.
